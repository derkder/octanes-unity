## Usage

After installation, choose `Spine` under the `Extensions` menu.

For the `Spine Export` option, for each leaf layer, an image will be written to the specified output directory. By default, a Spine JSON file will be generated in the output directory and images will be output to the `./images` directory within it.

For the `Spine Export - Paths` option, a Spine JSON file containing the Inkscape paths will be generated.

The Spine JSON files can be [imported](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-import) into Spine.
