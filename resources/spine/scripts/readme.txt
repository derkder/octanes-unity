
These scripts export images from Adobe PhotoShop, Illustrator, and other image
editing tools for use in Spine.

You can find the very latest Spine export scripts by downloading and
reinstalling Spine or by visiting the spine-scripts GitHub repository [1].

In addition to exporting images, some scripts also write JSON data which can be
imported into Spine [2]. This brings the images into Spine with the exact
positions and draw order they had in the image editing software, which can
greatly reduce the effort needed to initially set up a skeleton or skin.
